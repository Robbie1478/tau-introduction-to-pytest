### Chapter 1 - The First Test Case

#### Running a Test

```bash
Notice that both our module and our function contain the prefix test_. 

When pytest runs, it will discover tests from its current directory down. 
By default, any function names with the prefix test_ in any modules with the prefix test_
will be identified and executed as test cases.
```

`You can from the command line using python -m pytest.`
